# Flowav
Generate levels and gameplay from audio sources. Even though Flowav will contain awesome visual assets, **all the levels need to be playable by sightless players**. Sound effects and music will play a vital roll. Haptic effects may play secondary rolls.

## Difficulty
- Idle
- Trance
- Exciting

## PX
Players can "trance out" and not think too much. Picking up orbs that float to the surface.

## World
Floating and sailing on top of the poison gas. The gas curls up as we pass by in our skiff. We can see terrain sticking up from the gas clouds. Our speakers pump out particle waves of music to draw out the _buoyancy orbs_ that

## Tempoest 2000!
Each sound event should allow the players to respond with a predictable pattern.

### Custom Levels
- Level Generator: The user can add music of their own that will auto generate levels.
- Generator Seed: an integer that can be passed to friends that will sync the experience.

## Assets
We need these assets. Need chill bgm for a relaxing game.
