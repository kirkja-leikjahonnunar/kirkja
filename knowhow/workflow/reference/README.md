# Collecting Reference Workflow
Reference can be any type of media that communicates the next steps the asset needs to proceed:

- Text descriptions.
- Image search.
- Concept art.
- Photos.
- Maquettes.
- Drawings on napkins.
- Wireframe drawings.
- Lego bricks.
- A cut-up paper bag with stickers.
- Any; or all of the above!
