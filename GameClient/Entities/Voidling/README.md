# Voidling

The **voidling** entity essentially acts as the player's 3D in-game cursor. Voidlings are ephemeral entities that may intersect and pass through objects. As a voidling, we will be able to travel around the world of Kirkja looking for [new contexts](../Context) to inhabit.



## Movement
The voidling should be able to access a reasonable amount of 3D space. (maybe 3 times higher than a default jump?) Voidlings primarily move forward and back, left and right, but can learn skills to fly up and down, stick to walls, and twist into hidden worlds.

Voidling movement is limited by a fog-of-war, but the fog is lifted as we travel around the world in new contexts.

Voidlings may use contexts to **interact** and **affect** the in-game world. Contexts are usually NPC quest givers, but could also be animals, or inanimate objects.
