# Void Space

The **Void Space** map represents one's private space for in-game creations, game saves, account bound items, completion progress, location warping, world map, achievements, friends, groups, guilds, etc.

Void space may only be accessed from one's voidling form. Void Space begins to materialize around the player's voidling once the player is AFK for more than 5 seconds and completely solidifies after 15 seconds of in activity.

Void Space exists on top of the current environ.
